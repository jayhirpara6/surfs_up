Analyzing weather data

# Overview of analysis
The purpose of our analysis is to see temperature statistics for June and December to see if running a surf shop is sustainable year around. The queries used to pull temperature data, are exactly the same, but we just alter the month fliter from June to December. We then stored down the data we found into 2 data frames, one for each month. Once our dataframe is created we are able to get our summary statistics, which you can see below:


# Results

-- December is a slightly colder month than June, on average 3 degrees lower in temperature.

# Summary 

Given that the data we had provided more extensive weather data, we would need to run more queries to see the viablility of having a surf shop open in June/Dec. Other data includes, precipitation, etc.
