Analyzing weather data

# Overview of analysis
The purpose of our analysis is to see temperature statistics for June and December to see if running a surf shop is sustainable year around. The queries used to pull temperature data, are exactly the same, but we just alter the month fliter from June to December. We then stored down the data we found into 2 data frames, one for each month. Once our dataframe is created we are able to get our summary statistics, which you can see below:

# Summary 

From our data we can tell what our temperatures are but since there are other attributes to the weather such as precipitation it shows that we can run additional queries to let us know whether or not people can come and visit the shop. If we are able to gain more data for the area we can run even more queries! From there we can decide how we would like to build the shop and what areas would make this a more prominent location for visitors to come.
